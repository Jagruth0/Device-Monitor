# Device-Monitor
Web app to monitor your device's(raspberry pi) resources.  

The site displays following metrics as a line graph:  
- CPU Usage (as %)
- Free memory (value and %)
- CPU Temperature (in 'C)  

Apart from these metrics, the app also shows the top 5 CPU consuming process currently running, along with their details in a table.  
Device info such as platform, architecture, uptime, etc are shown at the bottom.  

All this data refreshes once every 2 seconds and the line graph shows data for the last 120 seconds (60 data points).  

### Pi Assistant

This generates a shell script that is apt for the given query.
